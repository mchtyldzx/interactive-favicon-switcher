# Interactive Favicon Switcher

**Interactive Favicon Switcher** is a web project that dynamically changes the favicon based on user interactions such as clicking and scrolling, as well as the time of day. The favicon changes to reflect different "mood" states, providing an engaging and interactive experience for users.

## Features

- **Mood-based Favicon**: The favicon changes based on the user's happiness level, which increases by clicking on the page.
- **Time-based Favicon**: During night hours (8 PM to 6 AM), the favicon switches to a night-themed icon.
- **Click Power**: Each click on the page increases your happiness level, and the click power grows as your happiness level rises.
- **Scrolling Favicon**: While scrolling, the favicon changes to a "scrolling" state for a brief moment.
- **Stats Panel**: Displays the current happiness level, the user's level, and the current click power.

## How It Works

- The favicon will change depending on the happiness level (sad, normal, happy, or super).
- Every click on the page increases the happiness, which in turn improves the favicon state.
- At night, the favicon switches to a "night" state.
- Scrolling will temporarily change the favicon to a "scrolling" state.
- Stats related to the user's happiness level and click power are shown at the top-right corner.
